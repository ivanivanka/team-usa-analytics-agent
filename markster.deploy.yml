# Inventory service id (from markster-ops inventory/services.yml)
service_id: your-service-id

# Optional mapping from repo env names to inventory env names.
# Example: if your repo uses "production" but inventory uses "prod".
# envs:
#   production: prod
#   staging: staging

# Optional provider-specific mapping (informational today).
# Naming: `service_id` always means Markster inventory service id.
# Provider IDs must use provider-prefixed names (example: `railway_service_id`).
# Prefer per-service provider mappings under `services:` (supports multi-service repos).
#
# services:
#   - service_id: your-service-id
#     default: true
#     railway:
#       project_id: your-railway-project-id
#       railway_service_id: your-railway-service-id
